# Change Point Analysis for Edge Effects
R Code for Estimating Edge Effects using Change Point Analysis

The provided package includes a demo file (changepoint_demo.R), a source file (changepoint_functions.R), and a sample dataset (modern.csv) with both a continuous and a count variable. Please use the most updated versions of R (https://cran.r-project.org/) and packages for scripts to run properly. Packages required include lme4 and Hmisc. All files must be located within the same working directory. 

Note that the initial steps of the model involve delineating plot locations as either within a wilderness/affected area (positive values) or a non-wilderness/area having the effect (negative values). Other sampling schema require modifications as appropriate. Further details about the method or functions are commented within the files. 

Please contact K. Michels with any questions or for consultation. Feel free to modify these functions as allowed by the MIT open source license guidelines.
